# Quiz Management System

The Quiz Application is a Java-based console application designed to simulate basic quiz application. It allows users to select from a series of multiple choice questions and their score is calculated and displayed to the user. This README provides an overview of the application's features, how to set it up, and how to use it effectively.

## Features

- Selecting The number of questions the user wants to answer.
- An interface that displays each question for the user.
- Selecting correct answer from multiple choice questions.
- Scoring of the test taken by the user.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source files using the command: `javac *.java`

## Usage Example

1. Create an instance of `QuizApp` by running the application.
2. Follow the console prompts to perform account operations.

## Considerations and Future Enhancements

- The application is made in a way that the questions are hard coded. A possible enhancement would be to have a database for the application.
- The project specified that we should connect to an interface. This can only be done if the application is an API.
